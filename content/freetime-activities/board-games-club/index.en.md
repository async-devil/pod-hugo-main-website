Contact to the admin of the room can be found in the [Contacts]({{< ref "/contacts/index.md##board-games-room" >}}).

Boargame club has a long tradition at the dormitory, through which we managed to collect a huge variety of board games. Relax, get to know people or participate in one of our tournaments.

The board games room can be accessed weekly on playing days or after an agreement with the board games admin with a group of your friends. Some of the games can be lent to take to your room. Visit our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hrypodolee) to know a bit more about us.

The list of available boardgames is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ocg36A2OPQALA3ums7OLA13KTKw1npZr3auANkEogjc/edit?usp=sharing).
