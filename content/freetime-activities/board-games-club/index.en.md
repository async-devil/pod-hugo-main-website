Contact to the admin of the room can be found in the [Contacts]({{< ref "/contacts/index.md##board-games-room" >}}).

Boargame club has a long tradition at the dormitory, through which we managed to collect a huge variety of board games. Relax, get to know people or participate in one of our tournaments.

The board games room can be accessed every wednesday from 20:00 in the room B206 or after an agreement with the board games admin with a group of your friends. Some of the games can be lent to take to your room. Visit our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hrypodolee) to know a bit more about us.

The list of available boardgames is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ocg36A2OPQALA3ums7OLA13KTKw1npZr3auANkEogjc/edit?usp=sharing).
