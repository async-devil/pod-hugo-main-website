The Storage room is a room to store things (e.g. fridge, microwave and small furniture) during the summer break. It always opens at the beginning and end of the summer break. Storage is free for club members with a valid basic membership.

You can find it in the basement of block A, room 19.

The Storage room opening is managed by the Storage room Administrator (<kufrarna@pod.cvut.cz>) The opening dates are always announced in advance. It is not possible to open the Storage room individually. If you are not able to come during the dates listed, please send us your suggestions for dates (at least 3 workdays in advance) and if more people are interested, we will open at another date.

Before storing your belongings, it is necessary to read the Operation rules and understand the rules for the storage of your belongings.
