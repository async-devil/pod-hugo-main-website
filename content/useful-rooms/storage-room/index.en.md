The room is used for storing things at the summer break time. It can be found in the basement of block A. It opens every start and end of summer holidays.
Storing is free.

Storage room opening is managed by the block administrators (<admins@pod.cvut.cz>). Opening dates are posted gradually, there is no way of opening the storage room individually.
If there is no suitable day of opening send date suggestions (at least 3 workdays prior) and if there are more interested people, the storage room will be opened another date.

## Storing rules:

1. Stored object needs to be labeled by the name and room number. Will be monitored at the handover.
2. Stored object needs to be clean and must not be perishable (foodstuff).
3. Stored fridge must be cleaned and unfrozen. It is highly recommended to secure the doors slightly open in order not to stale the fridge.
